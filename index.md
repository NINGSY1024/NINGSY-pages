## [Grad_Project 1](https://ningsy1024.github.io/NINGSY-pages/Projects/Bayesian%20Neural%20Networks%20via%20Langevin%20MCMC.html) Sunspot Number Forecasting: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) via MCMC

Final Project for PC5251 Applied Machine Learning.

-	Utilized conjugate prior and Gaussian likelihood to construct the Bayesian probabilistic model.
-	Implemented stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for the proposal distribution in MCMC sampling.
-	Exhibited the distribution of each parameter (weight and bias) in three-layer neural networks.
-	Obtained high-accuracy predictions with confidence intervals and conducted Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic


## [Grad_Project 2](https://ningsy1024.github.io/NINGSY-pages/Projects/Deep%20Learning%20the%20Phase%20Transition.html) Deep Learning the Phase Transition: A CNN Approach to the 2D Ising Model
 
Research project in PC5212 Numerical Recipes

-	Used the Monte Carlo method to obtain representative sets of spin configurations for a bunch of temperatures.
-	Trained convolutional neural network via PyTorch to classify configurations and predict the critical temperature.

## [Undergrad_Project 1](https://ningsy1024.github.io/NINGSY-pages/Projects/numerical-simulation-of-quantum-size-effects-html.html) Numerical Simulation of Quantum Size Effects in Nanomaterials
